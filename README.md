Magnifier Tweak Tool
--------------------
# Introduction
The Magnifier Tweak Tool (MTT) is a python command line application for controlling screen magnification features. Initially aimed at GNOME Shell it may in time integrate with other desktop environments. The goal of this project is to allow users who find screen magnification useful to be able to access the full range of features offered by their desktop environment and to build on these features to provide more advanced functionality.  
# Supported Magnifiers
